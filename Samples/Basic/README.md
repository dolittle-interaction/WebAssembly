# Basic Sample

[NodeJS](https://www.nodejs.org) is required for this sample to run a simple Web server.
Once you have NodeJS installed, run the following from your shell:

```shell
$ yarn
$ yarn run start
```

With it running you can compile the [.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net) project by running:

```shell
$ dotnet build
```

It will run a post build step that packages the artifacts needed to run the solution.
Once this is running, you simply navigate to [http://localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html).
